// The node-key half of the fidelity mapping (F8/F9) — WHICH APP NODE STANDS FOR WHICH DRAWN NODE.
//
// Split out of frames.js when F9 gave every screen family its own data module. These tables describe
// the PROTOTYPE'S tree, not the app's data, and they are the one thing a data module may need from
// outside itself — so they live in a leaf with no imports at all, and nothing here can close a cycle
// back through `ui/`.
//
// `extract.mjs` derives a key per drawn node (`header/span[2]`, `div[2]/div[0]/span[1]`); nothing can
// derive which APP node corresponds, because the two trees differ by design — F4 wraps the app mark
// in a `<button>` the frames draw bare, and every screen diverges further. So each frame says it
// here, once, and `ui/chrome.js` and `ui/compact.js` stamp `data-fid` from it via `fid()`.
//
// A slot declared here that the frame has no node for is inert — `fid()` is only called where the
// screen renders that slot — but it is also a trap, because assert.mjs fails on a STAMPED key that
// does not exist. `check-fixtures.mjs` fails the build on a slot whose key exists in no frame that
// declares it, which is how the dead `hexRect`/`hexNumeral` declarations below were found.

 *
 * Written as a factory rather than as eight literal tables because the eight frames are four tree
 * SHAPES with different tails — and a factory states the correspondence once instead of eight times,
 * which is the form a reviewer can actually check. It is still hand-written: nothing derives which
 * app node stands for which drawn one, and this is where that judgement lives.
 *
 * Two rules the prototype's key scheme imposes, both of which produce silently-wrong maps if missed:
 *
 *   · AN INDEX APPEARS ONLY WHEN A TAG HAS SIBLINGS OF ITS OWN TAG. The settled mark's two paths are
 *     `path[0]`/`path[1]`; the needs-you mark's single path is `path`, with no index at all. Hence
 *     `HEX_PATHS`.
 *   · THE MENU'S SEPARATOR IS A CHILD LIKE ANY OTHER. `10a Settled` draws rows at `div[0..2]`, the
 *     rule at `div[3]`, and the last two rows at `div[4]`/`div[5]` — so rows are keyed by their
 *     position among all children, which is what `menuSection` stamps.
